			<h1>WSP Top Stone, Inc. Project Analysis</h1>
			<h3>Nicholas Kruger</h3>
			<div id="site_intent">
				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this redesign project for <a href="http://topstone1.com/">topstone1.com<a> is to streamline the content from dozens of pages down to six pages, create 
				proper visual hierarchy to guide the user to a successful purchase, and create a visual aesthetic that more accurately represents Top Stone, Inc. as a company that specializes 
				in customized commercial and residential rolling stone sphere fountains. By organizing the user interface in logical design patterns and unifying the color palette, the site will 
				provide a more enjoyable and productive user experience for potential customers. The site will be recoded from the ground up to eliminate the numerous errors in the markup,  
				separate the content from styling to be inline with industry standards for usability and accessibility, and add responsive design elements to meet the needs of mobile, tablet, and desktop users.</p>

			<div id="competitive_analysis">
				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
				<p><strong>Potential Search Terms:</strong> rolling stone sphere, stone fountain, outdoor fountain, indoor fountain, marble sphere, red stone sphere, baseball (basketball, golf, soccer, football, billiard ball) fountain, home and garden, gardening, decorating, decoration, water sculpture, rolling globe sculpture, ball fountain, rolling ball fountain, marble ball fountain, floating ball fountain</p>
				<p>While Top Stone, Inc. has several competitors with a significant web presence, no other company is as focused as tightly on the customized rolling stone fountains. The current site does not receive enough traffic to produce reliable statistics and the competition is receiving traffic from searches that have only a small relevance to the products of topstone1.com. Highlighting 
				the level of customization and help with installation will be necessary to differentiate Top Stone from larger sellers like alibaba.com, lowes.com, and ebay.com. One area where competitors are stronger than Top Stone is in the presentation of the products and ease of use in the purchasing process. The current site is lacking in white space to frame the images of the products, 
				as well as an intuitive form for making a purchase (currently potential customers are directed to call or send an email).</p>

				<h2>Target Audience</h2>
				<p>Charlie is a  59 year old stockbroker with a vacation home in Palm Harbor, Florida. He enjoys spending at least one weekend a month in Florida with his 3 grandchildren. The children love swimming in the pool and running around the expansive backyard since most of the year they live in an appartement in New York City. The children were fascinated by a rolling stone sphere fountain they saw at a museum last year and Charlie wants to get one to place next to the pool as a surprise for the next time they can get together. 
				Charlie has an idea about the size of the sphere and base that he wants, but still isn't sure about what kind of stone he should get, or what design will work best with the design of his pool and the landscaping around it. He is someone who is used to making decisions after examining lots of information about a subject, usually in the form of reports with graphs and charts.</p>
				<p>Susan is a 39 year old interior decorator who just landed a contract to redesign the interior of a small airport just outside of Chattanooga, TN. This is her first large commercial client since starting her on business and knows that making a good impression with the client and travelers to the airport will be crucial to her future success. In order to impress her new client she wants to make sure she is staying within budget and on schedule, meaning she needs her suppliers to do the same. 
				She has a busy life between work and her two children so she needs to be able to interact with her suppliers when she has the spare time, even if that means through the web on her iPhone while waiting in the car line at her children's school.</p>
